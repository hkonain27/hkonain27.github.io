            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Hafsa Konain, junior at UNC, Charlotte. Since third grade, I've loved doing arts and crafts as a hobby. Making things by hand has evolved into a visual outlet for my ideas and thoughts over the years. Apart from doing Arts and craft, playing badminton, baking and photography are my other hobbies.</p>
            <h3>My Backgound in Arts and Craft:</h3>
            <p> Since a young age, I dedicated myself to arts and crafts. I have experimented with a variety of crafts since third grade, when my love for creating first emerged. Creating elaborate designs that showcase cultural artistry is something I enjoy doing in addition to drawing, painting, and paper crafts like origami and card crafting. I also participate in do it yourself activities like modelling clay, creating jewellery, and reusing existing objects into new decorations. More than simply a hobby, arts and crafts provide me with a means of relaxation, creative expression, and knowledge acquisition with every activityÂ I take on.</p>
