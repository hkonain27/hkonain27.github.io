                            <p>Holi is called the festival of colors, spring, and love. It is the most popular and significant Hindu holiday that marks the beginning of Spring. The festival is symbolic of the triumph of good over evil and has been celebrated since the 4th century CE. We will be providing colors free of charge. We are honored to have DJ Maks of Maks Entertainment providing live DJ services for the event. This event is funded in part by the Student Government Association with your student activity fees.</p>
